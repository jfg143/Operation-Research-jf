Algorithms for opeartion Research

In this repository we have two algorithms.

  - TSP (Travelling salesman problem): We have to find the optimum route visiting only one time our vertices. Here we use a multithread program to solve it.
  This problem is a NP-Hard so find the optimal solution of it require a lot of time. This problem is solve every day so it's 
  important to find a good solution of it.
  
  - VRP (Vehicle Routing Problem): Here we have another NP-problem which we solve using the TSP algorithms and Dijstra's algorithm. Actually
  I am improving this algorithm. In the near future I want to solve a VRPTW (Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows).
