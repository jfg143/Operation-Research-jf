Algoritms for opeartion Research

In this repository we have two algoritms.

  - TSP (Travelling salesman problem): We have to find the optimum route visit only one time our vertex. Here we use a multithread program.
  This problem is a NP-Hard problem so find the optimal solution of it require a lot of time. This problem is solve every day so it's 
  important to find the best solution.
  
  - VRP (Vehicle Routing Problem): Here we have another NP-problem which we solve using the TSP algoritm and Disjtra's algoritm. Actually
  I am improving this algoritm. In the near future I want to solve a VRPTW (Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows).
